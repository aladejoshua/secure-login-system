Secure Login System Project To-Do List
Project Overview
Develop a secure login system using Python with two-factor authentication (2FA), encryption, and additional security measures to enhance cybersecurity skills.

1. Planning and Research

 Define project requirements
Specify features: user registration, login, 2FA, password encryption, session management.
Identify security goals: protect against SQL injection, brute force, session hijacking.


 Research security best practices
Study OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, broken authentication).
Learn about secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
Explore 2FA methods (e.g., TOTP, email-based).


 Select tools and libraries
Python libraries: bcrypt for password hashing, pyotp for TOTP-based 2FA, cryptography for encryption.
Database: SQLite for simplicity, or PostgreSQL for scalability.
Development tools: Git for version control, VS Code for IDE, pylint for code linting.
Testing tools: pytest for unit testing, Bandit for security linting.




2. Environment Setup

 Set up development environment
Install Python 3.11+.
Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv.
Install dependencies: pip install bcrypt pyotp cryptography flask pytest bandit.


 Configure version control
Initialize a Git repository: git init.
Create a .gitignore file for Python projects (ignore venv/, __pycache__/, etc.).
Push to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).


 Set up linting and testing tools
Configure pylint for code quality checks.
Install Bandit for static security analysis: bandit -r ..
Set up pytest for unit tests.




3. Core Development
3.1 User Registration

 Design database schema
Create tables for users (username, hashed password, email, 2FA secret).
Use SQLite/PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for ORM.


 Implement secure password hashing
Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing.
Ensure salt is automatically generated.


 Add input validation
Validate username (alphanumeric, length constraints).
Enforce strong password policies (min length, mix of characters).
Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.



3.2 Secure Login

 Implement login functionality
Create a login form using Flask (web framework).
Verify credentials securely using bcrypt.


 Add session management
Use Flask’s session management with secure cookies.
Set session timeouts and secure flags (HttpOnly, Secure).


 Prevent brute force attacks
Implement rate limiting using flask-limiter.
Add account lockout after failed attempts.



3.3 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

 Implement TOTP-based 2FA
Use pyotp to generate and verify TOTP codes.
Store 2FA secret in the database during user registration.
Provide QR code for users to scan with authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).


 Add fallback 2FA option
Implement email-based 2FA using smtplib for sending codes.
Ensure codes expire after a short period (e.g., 5 minutes).



3.4 Encryption

 Encrypt sensitive data
Use cryptography library to encrypt 2FA secrets and session tokens.
Implement symmetric encryption (e.g., Fernet) for simplicity.


 Secure database connections
Use TLS for PostgreSQL connections if applicable.
Avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext.




4. Security Enhancements

 Implement CSRF protection
Use Flask-WTF to generate and validate CSRF tokens for forms.


 Add secure headers
Configure HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options) using flask-talisman.


 Log security events
Log login attempts, failed 2FA, and suspicious activities using logging.
Store logs securely, avoiding sensitive data exposure.




5. Testing and Validation

 Write unit tests
Test password hashing and verification using pytest.
Test 2FA code generation and validation.
Test input validation and error handling.


 Perform security testing
Run Bandit to identify vulnerabilities: bandit -r ..
Test for SQL injection and XSS using manual inputs.
Use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite Community Edition for penetration testing.


 Test edge cases
Test with invalid 2FA codes, expired sessions, and brute force attempts.




6. Documentation and Learning

 Document the code
Add docstrings to functions and classes.
Create a README with project setup, usage, and security features.


 Write a project report
Explain design decisions, security measures, and lessons learned.
Highlight how OWASP principles were applied.


 Explore additional learning resources
Read “The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook” for security insights.
Complete TryHackMe or Hack The Box labs on authentication security.
Watch YouTube tutorials on Python security (e.g., LiveOverflow, John Hammond).




7. Deployment (Optional)

 Deploy to a local server
Use Gunicorn as a WSGI server: pip install gunicorn.
Run Flask app: gunicorn -w 4 app:app.


 Secure the deployment
Use Nginx as a reverse proxy with TLS (Let’s Encrypt).
Harden server configurations (e.g., disable unnecessary ports).


 Monitor and maintain
Set up basic monitoring for failed logins and server errors.
Regularly update dependencies: pip install --upgrade.
